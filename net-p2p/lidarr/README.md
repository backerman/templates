## Lidarr
Lidarr is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can
monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will
grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade
the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes
available.

## Usage

```shell
bastille template TARGET net-p2p/lidarr
```

For more options edit `/usr/local/bastille/templates/net-p2p/lidarr/Bastillefile`
